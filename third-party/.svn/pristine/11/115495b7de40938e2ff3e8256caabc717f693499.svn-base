JFreeChart 1.0.3:
-----------------
17 November 2006

This release features several new IntervalXYDataset implementations, some 
significant refactoring of the time period classes (to improve performance 
and correctness), modifications to the PiePlot class to support reordering of
dataset items, a new event mechanism to allow updating of markers, plus many
other enhancements, bug fixes and documentation updates.

A new DialPlot implementation has been added to the 'experimental' sources. 
We are looking for people to test this code and provide feedback, so that we
can stabilize the API and add this code to the main JFreeChart API.

API adjustments:

The following adjustments have been made to the API:

- CategoryLabelEntity - new class;
- CategoryPointerAnnotation - new class;
- ChartPanel: added new public method doEditChartProperties();
- ComparableObjectItem, ComparableObjectSeries - new classes;
- CrosshairState: added several new accessor methods;
- DefaultPieDataset: added sortByKeys() and sortByValues() methods;
- Markers: a change event mechanism has been added to the Marker class and
  its subclasses;
- StackedAreaRenderer: added get/setRenderAsPercentages() methods;
- XIntervalDataItem, XIntervalSeries and XIntervalSeriesCollection - new 
    classes;
- XYErrorRenderer: new class;
- XYInterval, XYIntervalDataItem, XYIntervalSeries and 
    XYIntervalSeriesCollection - new classes;
- YInterval, YIntervalDataItem, YIntervalSeries, YIntervalSeriesCollection and
    YWithXInterval - new classes.

Bug Fixes:

1578293 - Unused methods in JDBCXYDataset;
1572478 - BoxAndWhiskerRenderer potential NullPointerException;
1569094 - XYStepRenderer with horizontal orientation;
1565168 - Crosshair position incorrect;
1564977 - DateAxis missing initial tick label;
1562759 - StatisticalLineAndShapeRenderer constructor ignores arguments;
1557141 - Bad locale in ServletUtilities;
1550045 - TimeSeries.removeAgedItems() method problems;
1549218 - Chart not displaying when all data values are the same and large;
1450447 - Marker.setAlpha() ignored;

Also fixed URL generation for legend items, tick mark positioning on the 
DateAxis, the equals() method in the AreaRenderer class, hardcoded outline 
attributes in the XYBubbleRenderer, and potential NullPointerExceptions in the
ChartPanel class.


JFreeChart 1.0.2:
-----------------
Released on 25 August 2006.

API adjustments:

The following adjustments have been made to the API (there should be no 
breakage of applications coded to the 1.0.0 or 1.0.1 API):

- CategoryToPieDataset: added accessor methods for underlying dataset, extract
    type and index (feature request 1477915);
- DefaultXYDataset:  New dataset implementation that uses double[] arrays;
- DefaultXYZDataset:  New dataset implementation that uses double[] arrays;
- LegendItemBlockContainer: New container used in legends (enables 
    legend item entities again);
- MultiplePiePlot:  Added new fields aggregatedItemsKey and 
    aggregatedItemsPaint, plus accessor methods - see bug 1190647;
- SpiderWebPlot:  Added new fields toolTipGenerator and urlGenerator, plus 
    accessor methods (see patch 1463455);
- StackedBarRenderer3D:  Added new flag (renderAsPercentages), plus accessor
    methods, that controls whether the data items are displayed as values or
    percentages.  Two new constructors are also added (see patch 1459313);
- XYPolygonAnnotation: Added new accessor methods.

Patches:

1459313 - Add renderAsPercentages option to StackedBarRenderer3D;
1462727 - Modify SpiderWebPlot to support zero values;
1463455 - Modify SpiderWebPlot to support mouse clicks, tool tips and URLs;

Bug Fixes:

1514904 - Background image alpha in Plot class;
1499140 - ClusteredXYBarRenderer with margin not drawing correctly;
1494936 - LineAndShapeRenderer generates entity for non-visible item;
1493199 - NPE drawing SpiderWebPlot with null info;
1480978 - AbstractPieItemLabelGenerator.clone() doesn't clone percentFormat;
1472942 - DateAxis.equals() broken;
1468794 - StatisticalLineAndShapeRenderer doesn't draw error bars correctly
          when the plot has a horizontal orientation;
        - AbstractCategoryItemRenderer doesn't check seriesVisibleInLegend
          flag before creating new item;
1440415 - Bad distribution of pie chart section labels;
1440346 - Bad manifest entry for JCommon in JFreeChart jar file;
1435461 - NumberAxis.equals() ignores rangeType field;
1435160 - XYPointerAnnotation.equals() ignores x and y fields;
1398672 - LegendItemEntities not working;
1380480 - StandardXYItemRenderer problems with Double.NaN;
1190647 - Legend and section color mismatch for MultiplePiePlot.

Miscellaneous Changes:

- Updated CandlestickRenderer, CyclicXYItemRenderer, HighLowRenderer, 
  XYStepAreaRenderer and TimeSeriesURLGenerator to call dataset methods that 
  return double primitive only;
- Updated XYPolygonAnnotation, adding new accessor methods and fixing problems
  in the equals()/hashCode() methods;
- ChartFactory.createStackedXYAreaChart() now uses StackedXYAreaRenderer2, for
  better handling of negative values;
- Added crosshair support for XYBarRenderer.

Experimental Code:

In this release, some new (incomplete) classes have been included in the 
org.jfree.experimental.* namespace.  These classes are not part of the 
standard API, but are included for developers to experiment with and provide
feedback on.  Hopefully in the future, refined versions of these classes will
be incorporated into the main library.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE API FOR THESE
CLASSES IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. 


JFreeChart 1.0.1:
----------------
Released 27 January 2006.  This is primarily a bug fix release.  In addition,
there are some API adjustments (there should be no breakage of applications 
coded to the 1.0.0 API).

API adjustments:
- BarRenderer: added a new flag (includeBaseInRange), plus accessor 
    methods, that controls whether or not the base value for the bar is 
    included in the range calculated by the findRangeBounds() method;
- BubbleXYItemLabelGenerator: new class;
- Range: added a new method expandToInclude(Range, double), this is used by 
    the BarRenderer class;
- TaskSeriesCollection: added two new methods, getSeries(int) and 
    getSeries(Comparable).
- TimeSeriesCollection:  the domainIsPointsInTime flag has been deprecated.  
    The flag serves no function now that renderers are used to calculate the 
    domain bounds, so you can safely delete any calls to the
    setDomainIsPointsInTime() method;
- XYPlot: added a new getAnnotations() method;
- XYSeries: the update(int, Number) method has been deprecated and a new method
    updateByIndex(int, Number) has been added;

Bug fixes:

1243050 - XYBarRenderer doesn't show entire range of values for a 
          TimeSeriesCollection;
1373371 - XYBubbleRenderer doesn't support item labels;
1374222 - BarRenderer contains JDK 1.4 specific code;
1374328 - LegendItem serialization problem;
1377239 - Bad argument checking in Quarter constructor;
1379331 - Incorrect drawing of TextTitle at LEFT or RIGHT position;
1386328 - RingPlot entity incorrect;
1400442 - Inconsistent treatment of null and zero values in PiePlot;
1401856 - Bad rendering for non-zero base values in BarRenderer;
1403043 - NullPointerException in CategoryAxis;
1408904 - NumberAxis3D assumes CategoryPlot;
1415480 - XYTextAnnotation equals() method doesn't check (x, y);


JFreeChart 1.0.0:
----------------
Released on 2 December 2005.
