# SILO - Simple Integrated Land-Use Orchestrator

This repository contains a JIBE-specific implementation of the Java-based [SILO](https://github.com/msmobility/silo) software for modelling travel demand.  

The main branch has [merged code](https://github.com/msmobility/silo/tree/transportHealthIntegrationModel_jibe) developed by Qin Zhang and Corin Staves for the JIBE project's [Manchester](https://github.com/jibeproject/silo/tree/main/useCases/manchester/src/main/java/de/tum/bgu/msm) implementation, with further health model development by IsmaÃ¯l Saadi, Ali Abbas, Tabea Sonnenschein, and Marina Berdikhanova, and implementation of the Melbourne use-case scenarios by Carl Higgs.  Project CIs are Belen Zapata-Diomedi and Prof James Woodcock.

Please see [the wiki](https://wiki.tum.de/display/msmmodels/MITO) for documentation.
