# SILO - Simple Integrated Land-Use Orchestrator

This repository contains a JIBE-specific implementation of the Java-based [SILO](https://github.com/msmobility/silo) software for modelling travel demand.  

The main branch has [merged code](https://github.com/msmobility/silo/tree/transportHealthIntegrationModel_jibe) developed by Dr Qin Zhang and Dr Corin Staves for the JIBE project's [Manchester](https://github.com/jibeproject/silo/tree/main/useCases/manchester/src/main/java/de/tum/bgu/msm) implementation and will be further developed for the Melbourne implementation ([TO DO](https://github.com/jibeproject/silo/issues/9)).

Please see [the wiki](https://wiki.tum.de/display/msmmodels/MITO) for documentation.
